## Project Overview

The **2-bit digital comparator** project presents a CMOS-based circuit designed to compare two 2-bit binary inputs, `A` and `B`, and output three signals indicating their relationship: whether `A` is **less than**, **equal to**, or **greater than** `B`. The circuit was designed using **CMOS gates** such as AND, OR, XNOR, and inverters to achieve accurate and power-efficient performance. The netlist provides a foundational structure for simulating the circuit and guiding its layout.

## Objectives

1. **Design** a 2-bit CMOS comparator.
2. Generate three output signals indicating the comparison result (`A < B`, `A = B`, `A > B`).
3. Implement the circuit using **basic CMOS gates**.
4. Verify the circuit's operation in **WinSpice**.
5. Develop a layout suitable for fabrication using **Microwind**.

## Design Description

### Circuit Operation

The comparator circuit receives two 2-bit binary inputs, `A (A1A0)` and `B (B1B0)`, and produces the following outputs:
- **`A < B`**: Active when `B` is greater than `A`.
- **`A = B`**: Active when both inputs are equal.
- **`A > B`**: Active when `A` is greater than `B`.

### Logic Implementation

- **Equality (`A = B`)**: Achieved using **XNOR gates** for each bit pair and an **AND gate** to combine the results.
- **Less Than (`A < B`)**: Implemented with **AND gates** to evaluate conditions like `A1 < B1` or, if `A1 = B1`, `A0 < B0`.
- **Greater Than (`A > B`)**: Uses **AND gates** for scenarios where `A` has higher bits than `B`.
